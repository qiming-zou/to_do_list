# Distributional Reinforcement Learning 
Distributional reinforcement learning is used in reinforcement learning to learn the distribution of the return (i.e., the sum of rewards) rather than just its expected value. This allows the agent to capture the uncertainty in the environment and make more informed decisions.

One of the main benefits of distributional reinforcement learning is that it can handle non-stationary and multi-modal environments. In a non-stationary environment, the distribution of returns can change over time, and a distributional approach can capture this change. In a multi-modal environment, there may be multiple optimal policies or actions, and a distributional approach can represent this by learning a distribution of returns with multiple peaks.

Another benefit of distributional reinforcement learning is that it can provide a richer signal for policy improvement. Instead of just using the expected value of the return as the target for the value function, a distributional approach can use the entire distribution of returns to guide policy improvement. This can lead to more robust and adaptive policies.

Overall, distributional reinforcement learning is a powerful approach that can improve the performance of reinforcement learning agents in complex and uncertain environments.
